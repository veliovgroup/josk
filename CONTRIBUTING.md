### I'm having an issue:
 1. Search [issues](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/josk/issues), maybe your issue is already solved
 2. Before submitting an issue make sure it's only related to `josk` package
 3. If your issue is not solved:
     - Give an expressive description of what is went wrong
     - Version of `josk` you're experiencing this issue
     - Version of `Node.js`, `NPM` and `MongoDB` you're experiencing this issue
     - If you're getting an error (exception), please provide full error log (output in console) as file or screenshot

### I have a suggestion:
 1. PRs are always welcome - [send a PR](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/josk/compare)
 2. If you're can not send a PR for some reason:
     - Create a new issue ticket
     - Describe your feature / request
     - How you're going to use it? Give a usage example(s)

### Documentation is missing something or incorrect (have typos, etc.):
 1. PRs are always welcome - [send a PR](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/josk/compare)
 2. If you're can not send a PR to docs for some reason:
     - Create a new issue ticket
     - Give a short description what you have changed/added and why
     - Make sure you're using correct markdown markup
     - Make sure all code blocks starts with tripple ``` (*backtick*) and have a syntax tag, for more read [this docs](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/#syntax-highlighting)
     - Post addition/changes as issue ticket, we will manage it
